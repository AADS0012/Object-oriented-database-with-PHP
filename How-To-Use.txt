This is a simple Object-Oriented Database With php project. It uses a simple database to
store and retrieve data. The database is implemented as a class, and it has methods
for CRUD operations (CREATE: Insert | READ: Select or Select All | UPDATE: Update | DELETE: Delete).

How To Use:
------------ Create a database --------------------
1. unComment Line 2 to 5 and initialize the Variables

2. create a database Within lines 7 to 18 or with phpmyAdmin

------------ Create a Table --------------------

1. create a table, you need to first create a Db object and connect to the database with the 
connect_database() function, which is one of the Db methods.

2. with the create_table() method, which requires a parameter, 
which is the query you want to use to create your table.

3. I have put an example for you in the index.php file.

which defaults to PDO::FETCH_ASSOC mode, and this parameter must be of the PDO class type.
